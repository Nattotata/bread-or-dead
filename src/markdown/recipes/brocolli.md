## Ingredients

- Brocolli (500 g)
- Starch (1 tablespoon)
- Soya sauce (2 tablespoons)
- Garlic (up to taste)
- Ginger (up to taste)
- Sugar (1 teaspoon)

## Steps

1. Clean the brocolli and cut into smaller pieces. Try to preserve the flowers as much as possible.
1. Boil the brocolli in rolling boil for 3-5 minutes.
1. Once boiled, rinse them with cold water and put into an ice bath. This will keep them crunchy and colourful.
1. Chop the garlic and ginger. Fry them for about 30 seconds.
1. Add brocolli to the frying pan (ideally wok).
1. Prepare a starch slurry from starch, water, soya sauce, and sugar.
1. Add the slurry to the frying pan, mix well, cook for a few minutes.

## Notes

- I didn't follow the recipe step by step for a long time so the steps might differ from the video.
- Lau uses two soya sauces. One is less salty. I usually have just very salty soya sauce, so I dillute it with water.
- I think that Lau uses cooking wine in the slurry.
- Try to not overcook the brocolli. The brocolli seems raw but is perfectly edible and I didn't have any side-effects so far. And it tastes great.
- I tried mixing it up with other stuff (like tofu) to make a more complex meal, but I overcooked the brocolli. I always cook it separately now.
- Don't be shy with ginger, when cooked it looses the demonic raw taste. It's more like a citrus flavour.
- If you want to give it more punch, add more minced garlic right before you take it off heat. Garlic looses power with heat.
