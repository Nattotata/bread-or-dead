### Prepare a starter

1. If the starter is older than a week, your starter is ready.

1. Add 100g of water, 100g of flour, and mix thoroughly.
1. Cover with a paper towel.
1. Leave to rest in room temperature.
1. Go step 1

### Keeping the starter alive

Keep the starter in a fridge to hibernate.   
Feed every two months or more often.

Or keep the starter in room temperature, then feed every day.

## Bread

### Ingredients

* starter
* wholewheat flour
* water
* salt

### Steps


1. Feed your starter with flour and water to activate it.
1. Mix 350g of water and 500g of flour.
1. Leave to rest in room temperature for about 30 minutes (autolyse).
1. Once the starter is active (foamy, about 200% increase in volume), mix it in.
1. Add 10g of salt
1. Cover and leave to rest in room temperature  until the dough increases in volume by about 20%(2-6 hours).
1. Store in a fridge overnight (12-48 hours).
1. Preheat an over to 230°C.
1. Transfer the dough to a coverable thing (like a dutch oven). The cover traps steam from bread.
1. Score the bread -- make a long cut on the top of the bread. The steam will escape the bread through the cut.
1. Lower the temperature to 210°C. Bake the bread covered for 20 minutes.
1. Remove the cover and bake for 40 minutes.
1. Store the baked bread in room temperature, uncovered, for about two hours -- don't cut into it or eat it yet.
1. Ta-dah!
