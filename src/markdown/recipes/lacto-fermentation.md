title: Lacto-fermentating vegetables
---

## Ingredients

- Vegetables
- Salt
- Water
- (optional) Spices
- Glass jar

## Notes

- Veggies should sit in a salty, anaerobic environment (without air).
- The amount of salt is 2.5 % of total weight of veggies and water.
- The veggies should be submerged under water all time (use weight or a smaller lid).
- You can use more salt but not less (to kill unhealthy bacteria).
- The fermentation is done by lactic acid.
- Room temperature supports lactic acid that produces CO2 (there's a lot of bubbles on top and sides).
- Lower temperature supports something else that produces alcohol (something with ethanol? I need to find source)

## Steps

1. Clean veggies of your choice and chop them into a bite-size pieces.
2. Weight an empty jar.
3. Put the veggies in a jar and fill the jar with water to about 90% (you don't want the air capsule to be too big).
4. Add salt so that it's 2.5% of the weight of the water and veggies.
5. Loosely close the jar and keep it away from direct sunlight in room temperature.

For example: If you have 300g of veggies and need 200g of water to fill the jar, you'd add 12.5g of salt.
