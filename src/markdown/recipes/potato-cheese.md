title: Potato cheese
---


## Ingredients

* potatoes
* corn starch
* milk (any)
* salt
* turmeric powder (kurkuma)
* ground onion
* ground garlic
* nutritional yeast
* olive oil

## Steps

1. Steam the potatoes (about 15 minutes).
2. Peel the potato skin, and slice it into cubes.
3. Throw into blender along with the spices (salt, onion, garlic), nutritional yeast, and corn starch (i used about three table spoons of corn starch on five small potatoes).
4. Add just enough milk that the blender can function (less is better).
5. Blend until smooth, then blend some more. Add olive oil (two table spoons).
6. Pour the resulting paste on a non-sticking pan and slowly heat up (without oil).
7. Once the paste is thickening, wait a minute or two and turn the heat off.
8. Transfer the paste into a glass container and let it cool.
9. Store in a fridge over night, cover with a paper towel (to let the moisture escape).
10. Transfer the cheese into a freezer for about two hours (this dries it up even further).
